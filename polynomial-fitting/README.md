# least-square-fitting-of-straight-lines

In polynomial fitting, the goal is to find a polynomial of degree 𝑚
that best fits a set of data points(xi, yi) in a least-squares sense.
To do this, we set up a system of equations where the polynomial:
$$\[ p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots + c_m x^m \]$$
